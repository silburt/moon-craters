****Getting the data******
First create a folder on your home directory to house all your data. This will correspond to the ‘dir’ variable in moon_unet_s256_rings_public.py

From /scratch/r/rein/silburt/ on scinet, get the following numpy files, and copy them to the following folders within the ‘dir’ directory:

*File*				*Folder within ‘dir’*
train_data.npy   	->	Train_rings/
train_target.npy   	-> 	Train_rings/
dev_data.npy		->	Dev_rings/
dev_target.npy		->	Dev_rings
test_data.npy		->	Test_rings/
test_target.npy		->	Test_rings/
custom_loss_csvs.npy	->	Dev_rings_for_loss/
custom_loss_images.npy	->	Dev_rings_for_loss/

****Running the Code******
All the code is contained within moon_unet_s256_rings_public.py. The main parameters that you might want to change is at the bottom of the script, under #Arguments, Run#.

These parameters have explanations given. 

If you want to iterate over parameters (i.e. run a grid search), look for:
########## Parameters to Iterate Over ########## 
in the run_cross_validation_create_models function. I’ve given a simple example of how to do this.
